# working_with_unsupervised_ML

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to explore potential avenues to determine viable cryptocurrencies for an investment portfolio. Unsupervised machine learning will be used to determine relevant factors and number of clusters. The data will then depict how to evaluate these cryptocurrencies for their ability to perform.

## Results

The use of unsupervised machine learning techniques has allowed for the classification of tradable cryptocurrencies into 4 defined classes based on the three most relevant factors of each currency.

## Summary

The usage of unsupervised learning has given room to explore these cryptocurrencies into 4 different factors. This can be used to further determine which factors are the most important for successful and by extension profitable cryptocurrencies.
